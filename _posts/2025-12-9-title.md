This is my first blog post that I am posting because the github tutorial on how to build a website makes me do this. I finished the movie Novocaine today. It was a good movie with great fight scenes. It is about a guy with
CIPA(genetic immunity to pain) who meets a girl, falls in love, and goes on a date with her. The bank they both work at gets robbed and they take the girl. He uses his immunity to pain to save her. I found a fully wrapped up
chicken sandwich on the floor in sculpture class today. I ate half of it and put the rest in a plastic bag to heat up at home. I would have heated up more if the bag was bigger. Sculpture class sucks and the wire sculpting
unit we are doing is horrible and I am very bad at it. I am screwed because it is a major grade. I might have to work afterschool on it. This was my first blog post and will probably be my last.
